The mock data set contains random values for the number of crimes. 

The format remains the exact same as the real data set. 

Important to note:
- the values are much higher in this mock data than in the real data
- there are a lot more zeros in the real data, hence the methods chosen. 
- due to the structure of the data, the total rows and columns will not 
	equal the actual sums from the data as this was decided to be too 
	time consuming to produce, however, as total rows are not used in the 
	analysis this is not an issue for the mock data.The only limitation 
	for the mock data is that you cannot confirm Python checks with the raw data.
